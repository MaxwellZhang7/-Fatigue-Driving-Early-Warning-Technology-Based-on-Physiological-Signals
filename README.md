# Fatigue Driving Early-Warning Technology Based on Physiological Signals

## Introduction: 
This project focuses on developing a warning system for drowsy driving based on physiological signals. Drivers wear compact smart sensors that, in combination with vehicle-mounted peripherals, capture human physiological parameters. The system monitors indicators such as fatigue or other non-alert driving behaviors and provides real-time warnings via the vehicle display, while also recording data to the cloud. The research explores mathematical models correlating body temperature, heart rate, blood oxygen, respiratory rate, and blood pressure during fatigue. By integrating these fatigue patterns with external survey data, the project aims to generalize common trends in drowsy driving. An independent cloud database and web interface are developed, with feedback provided through a dedicated mobile app.
